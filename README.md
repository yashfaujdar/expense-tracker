Travel Budget and Expense Tracker
A Travel Budget and Expense Tracker is a tool that helps travelers plan and monitor their spending on trips, ensuring they stay within their budget. The tracker is typically structured with features to input expected expenses (such as flights, accommodation, food, and activities) and track actual spending in real-time, making it easier to avoid overspending.
